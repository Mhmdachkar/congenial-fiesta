# Movie Recommendation System

A collaborative filtering movie recommendation engine built with Python. Features multiple algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## Overview

This project builds a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering on the MovieLens 100K dataset. The system gives personalized movie recommendations through three approaches and includes evaluation metrics.

### Key Features

- Three recommendation algorithms: User-based, Item-based, Matrix Factorization
- Similarity calculations: Cosine similarity and Pearson correlation
- Data analysis with visualizations and statistics
- Model evaluation: RMSE and MAE metrics with train/test validation
- Interactive interface for real-time recommendations
- Handles large datasets efficiently

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

2. Download the MovieLens 100K dataset or use your own ratings data
3. Ensure your ratings data is in CSV format with columns: user_id, item_id, rating, timestamp

### Usage

#### Basic Usage
```python
from movie_recommender import MovieRecommendationSystem

# Initialize the system
recommender = MovieRecommendationSystem('ratings.csv')

# Load and explore data
recommender.load_data()
recommender.explore_data()

# Get recommendations for user
recommendations = recommender.get_recommendations(user_id=1, method='user_based', n_recommendations=10)
print(recommendations)
```

#### Run Complete Analysis
```python
# Run the full system with interactive mode
python movie_recommender.py
```

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. Data Loader: Processes MovieLens data and converts to appropriate format
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization and statistics
3. Similarity Engine: Calculates user-user and item-item similarities
4. Recommendation Engine: Implements three collaborative filtering algorithms
5. Evaluation Module: Provides RMSE and MAE metrics
6. Interactive Interface: User-friendly recommendation interface

### Algorithms Implemented

#### User-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Finds users with similar rating patterns
- Recommends movies liked by similar users
- Uses mean-centered approach for better accuracy

#### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Identifies movies with similar rating patterns
- Recommends movies similar to user's highly-rated items
- More stable than user-based approach

#### Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition
- Handles sparsity better than memory-based approaches
- Provides latent factor interpretation

## Data Requirements

### Input Format
Your ratings.csv should contain:
- user_id: Unique identifier for users
- item_id: Unique identifier for movies
- rating: Rating value (typically 1-5)
- timestamp: Optional timestamp of rating

### Example Data Structure
```csv
user_id,item_id,rating,timestamp
1,31,2.5,1260759144
1,1029,3.0,1260759179
2,31,3.0,835355493
2,1029,2.0,835355493
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The system provides evaluation using:

- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Measures prediction accuracy
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average prediction error
- Coverage: Percentage of items that give recommendations
- Sparsity Analysis: Data density metrics

### Sample Results
```
Method Comparison:
user_based          - RMSE: 0.9234, MAE: 0.7123
item_based          - RMSE: 0.9156, MAE: 0.7089
matrix_factorization - RMSE: 0.8943, MAE: 0.6891
```

## Visualizations

The system generates visualizations:

1. Rating Distribution: Shows rating frequency and patterns
2. User Activity: Number of ratings per user
3. Movie Popularity: Rating frequency per movie
4. User Behavior: Average ratings and preferences
5. Temporal Analysis: Rating patterns over time
6. Similarity Heatmaps: User and item similarity matrices

## Advanced Features

### Hyperparameter Tuning
```python
# Adjust similarity metrics
recommender.calculate_user_similarity(method='cosine')  # or 'pearson'

# Modify neighborhood size
recommendations = recommender.get_recommendations(user_id=1, k=50)

# Change number of SVD factors
predictions = recommender.matrix_factorization_predict(user_id=1, item_id=50, k=100)
```

### Custom Evaluation
```python
# Evaluate specific method
results = recommender.evaluate_model(method='user_based', k=50, sample_size=1000)

# Compare all methods
recommender.compare_methods(user_id=1, n_recommendations=10)


## Data Processing Pipeline

1. Data Loading: Load MovieLens dataset
2. Data Exploration: Statistical analysis and visualization
3. Data Splitting: Train/test split for evaluation
4. Matrix Creation: User-item sparse matrix construction
5. Similarity Calculation: Cosine/Pearson similarity matrices
6. Model Training: Build recommendation models
7. Evaluation: Performance metrics calculation
8. Recommendation: Generate personalized suggestions
